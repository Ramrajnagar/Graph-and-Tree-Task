# Graph-and-Tree-Task
Welcome to this tutorial-style notebook where we explore graphs and trees through a practical, insightful example
This notebook includes 12 essential graph/tree coding tasks, explained using:

✅ Real-life analogies (like cities, family trees, WhatsApp groups)

✅ Beginner-friendly code comments

✅ Use of real classmate data (via source files)

✅ Graph theory applications in social networks




🔍 What You'll Learn

Task	Concept	Real-Life Analogy
1	Degree of Vertex	No. of friends you have
2	Convert Representations	Different ways to store contacts
3	Check Adjacency	Are two people directly connected
4	Is Complete Graph?	Group chat where everyone talks to everyone
5	Is Connected Graph?	Every city has a route to another
6	Walk / Trail / Path	Traveling without repeating places or roads
7	Is Tree?	Family tree or folder hierarchy
8	Spanning Tree	Connect cities with minimal roads
9	Leaf Nodes	Employees with no one reporting under them
10	Is Binary Tree?	Decision trees / limited options
11	Node Height	Tallest branch under a person
12	Node Depth	Person’s level in the hierarchy
